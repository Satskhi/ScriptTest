#The NCS Beta

### Introduction
Hello magnificant people! I was thinking that, while its not ready, I really want to allow other people to use NCS,
so I thought about it for a while, and finally decided that I would release this as beta. What does that mean?

Well, it means that the source is now open, however, its VERY early. There are bugs and not many features are out (as of Public release 1 Version 0.0.0.5).

So, you can just run NCS, or, modify it, make it better, distribute it (providing credit is given in the code), port it, whatever really.

We would really REALLY like the help of the community here to help make NCS a great script.

I want to make it clear that I don't want to overthrow RCS or anything. I made this when plug died, and I didn't really have plans to release this for plug.

Thanks!
