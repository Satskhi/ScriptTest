# Privacy Policy

When running NCS, a socket-connection will be established to one of our servers. This socket-connection will transfer some statistical data to our server.

Data we collect:
* Your username
* The room you joined

Data we do NOT collect
* Your IP-address
* Any other data

The data is destroyed as soon as you disconnect from the socket, e.g. through closing the browser tab or reloading the page without reloading NCS.

Any data is for statistical purpose only and will not be shared.
