# NCS (Nightcore Community Script)

### Installation and Activation

#### Note: This version of NCS will NOT work with alpha.nightcore-331.net OR musiqpad! This will ONLY work with plug.d!

### What is NCS

After plug.dj shut down, the people in the Nightcore-331 community built their own backup site. And while we've lost a lot of the people
we once had, we're ever growing once again. Because of this, we made NCS as a replacement for RCS, so that we can add features,
and other things, that the default Nightcore-331 just doesn't have. You can find the new site here: https://alpha.nightcore-331.net

Now, we're moving on to bigger things. A new platform known as Musiqpad is out in beta now, and so, NCS is moving over to it! There will be no more updates for alpha.nightcore-331.net's version of NCS, however it will remain available.

### Planned ports
We plan to port NCS over to turn.fm, and over to plug.dj again (if it ever re-releases). There are plans for musiqpad.

### Support/Help
If you need help, feel free to @CSxKING on Alpha or Discord. You may also contact @WindWalk on Alpha or Discord. (EDIT: Nvum's contact info has been removed due to him being removed from the project. He was removed as he has not helped much with the project in a very long time.)

If none are an option, you can email [CSxKING](mailto:csxking@electricgaming.ga) or [Fuechschen](mailto:me@fuechschen.org).
